# Bot Framework Emulator

As a bot developer, it's common to create, adapt, and test bot logic (and user experience elements) on your local computer, as you work through the design and development of your bots. To make it easy for developers to perform these tasks, Microsoft has developed multiple, open-source versions of the Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator for use on Linux, OSX, and of course, Microsoft Windows.

The Bot Framework Emulator is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

## Installation

To install the Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator:

1- Open a browser to the [Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator] (https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases) site.

2- Locate the OS-specific version of the Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator setup (such as “botframework-emulator-Setup-3.5.35.exe” if running Microsoft Windows) then click the link to begin the download process.

3- Unzip and/or install the Microsoft Bot Framework as appropriate for your platform.

4- When installation is complete, the Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator should begin a short validation process, then, after a short delay, load the emulator on your local computer.
